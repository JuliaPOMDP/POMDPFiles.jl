# STATES
#
# The states consist of a number of components.  First of all there is
# a distinguishing absorbing state.  The remaining 9 states are
# comprised of two attributes, each of which takes on 3 possible
# values. The two attributes, their values and the short-hand used to
# give the states their mnemonic names are:
#
# Machined State
#   o Slab (SLAB)
#   o Rough Machined (ROUGH)
#   o Final Machined (FINAL)
#
# Material Quality
#   o Grade A (A)
#   o Grade B (B)
#   o Grade C (C)
#
# The material quality refers to both the presence/absence of defects
# and the tolerances of the machined surfaces.
#
states:
	SLAB-A SLAB-B SLAB-C 
	ROUGH-A ROUGH-B ROUGH-C 
	FINAL-A FINAL-B FINAL-C 
	DONE

# ACTIONS
#
# The actions consist of predominantly two classes.  At each step
# either a processing and an inspection technique is chosen.  
#
# Inspection
#   o Ultrasonic for subsurface defects (UT)
#   o Liquid penetrant for surface defects (LP)
#   o Visual (VISUAL)
#
# Processes
#   o Machine the part (MACHINE)
#   o Paint/Anodize the part and ship it out for assembly (SHIP)
#   o Decide that the part is not salvagable or useable (SCRAP)

actions:
	UT LP VISUAL 
	MACHINE SHIP SCRAP

# OBSERVATIONS
#
# The observational information can either come from the processing
# actions or the inspection actions.  For the processing actions,
# often one gets some information about whether some spurious event
# might have caused the part to come under abnormal stresses (e.g.,
# broken cutter, dropped part).  We break these down into three
# possible outcomes:
#
#   o NORMAL - nothing out of the ordinary happened during processing
#   o QUESTIONABLE - nothing particularly significant happened, but
#                    things did not go exactly smoothly
#   o PROBLEM - there was a definite problem that occured during 
#               processing the part.
#
# For the inspection outcomes there is an outcome for each 
# possible material quality: GRADE-A, GRADE-B and GRADE-C.
# Grade A being nearly completely free of defects of any kind
# while Grade B has minor defects and Grade C has fairly
# major defects.

# MACHINE Action
#
# The machining process can introduce defects, either through the 
# machining itself or from handling the part. Thus the part quality 
# can degrade as a result of machinining.
# There is also a chance that the machining process could remove
# a defect, but we ignore this case.
# Note that machining a finished machined part is a bit odd, but
# we assume that should it be chosen it can introduce defects
# from the material handling phase.

# MACHINE Action
#
# Machining the part in the rough state
# consists of taking off a lot of material and
# handling a part which is fairly heavy.  Thus, you would imagine that
# the rough machining process should have a higher rate of something
# going wrong.  However, though this is true, the final machined part
# is much more delicate and the close tolerances makes it much more
# suspectible to damage.  Therefore there is roughly the same
# likelihood of something going wrong, though these are usually for
# slightly different reasons.  We skew the probabilities a bit, since
# something going wrong can be indicative of the part's quality
# degrading.  This model is a little too simple and it does not
# properly capture the coupling between something going wrong in the
# processing stage (a transition from good to bad) with the actual
# observation.
