# Simple web-like example for MCC job talk

# There are two type of consumers that visit your web site.  Your
# products fall into two categories, roughly along the same lines
# as your customers.  You have three choices to offer the visitors 
# your web site:  show them type 1 products, type 2 products or a
# random sampling of products.  You can view this as which products 
# to list first, or most prominently, etc.  You can track the products 
# they click on or show interest in to try to predict what type of 
# person they are. The risk is that showing the wrong products to 
# the wrong people, can cause them to leave your site.  The gain is that
# they may buy one of your products.
